<section id="week1">
    <h2>Week 1 (May 13 - May 19)</h2>
    <p>Read the papers "Automatic differentiation in ML: a Survey" and "Randomized Automatic Differentiation".</p>
    <p>Objective: Understand the math behind AD (accumulating partial derivatives) and investigate what RAD is, and compare with applying normal AD + Stochastic Gradient Descent.</p>
</section>
<section id="week2">
    <h2>Week 2 (May 20 - May 27)</h2>
    <p>Plan: Discuss papers with Professor Stefan Monnier and refamiliarize with functional programming. Watch Youtube tutorials.</p>

<section id="week3-4">
    <h2>Week 3 - 4 (May 28 - June 10)</h2>
    <p>Explore the different data structures used to accumulate the derivative. How is the concept of dual numbers applied in code, what is operator overloading, how to code the computation graph of a given haskell program/function.</p>

<section id="week5-7">
    <h2>Week 5 - 7 (June 11 - July 1)</h2>
    <p>Code the AD algorithm.</p>

<section id="week8-9">
    <h2>Week 8 - 9 (July 2 - July 15)</h2>
    <p>Debug, optimize, generalize if possible to more complex class of functions. Try adding stochastic elements in the computation of gradients (RAD)?</p>
</section>
<section id="week10-13">
    <h2>Week 10 - 13 (July 16 - August 5)</h2>
    <p>Finish reading additional papers, complete literature review, and finalize project report.</p>
