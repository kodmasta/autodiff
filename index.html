    <h1>Project Journal</h1>
    <p>Weekly updates on my progress implementing the reverse mode of the AD algorithm in Haskell.</p>
    <p>Project Description: Implement the reverse mode of the AD algorithm based on Haskell's typeclasses, which would work for any program written in Haskell. A literature review on AD and RAD (Randomized Automatic Differentiation).</p>
